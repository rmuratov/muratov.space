I love computers. I love sitting in front of the large display. I love typing on the full-featured keyboard. I love having multiple windows on the screen and switching between them. I love dealing directly with files. Create them, delete them, and know where they are on my filesystem. I love to install whatever software I want and use it to process my files.
