Occam's razor (or Ockham's razor) is a principle from philosophy. Suppose an event has two possible explanations. The explanation that requires the fewest assumptions is usually correct. Another way of saying it is that the more assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation. Occam's razor applies especially in the philosophy of science, but also appears in everyday life.

## History

[William of Ockham](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham), a Franciscan friar who studied logic in the 14th century, first made this principle well known. In Latin it is sometimes called **lex parsimoniae**, or "the law of briefness". William of Ockham supposedly (see below) wrote it in Latin:

- Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem.

This translates roughly:

- More things should not be used than are necessary.

## Further ideas

A problem with Occam's razor is that the sentence is not really about things (entia = entities), but about explanations or hypotheses. Other thinkers have come up with other versions:

> We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible
>
> Ptolemy.

## Examples

Example: Two trees have fallen down during a windy night. Think about these two possible explanations:

1. The wind has blown them down.
2. Two meteorites have each taken one tree down and, after striking the trees, hit each other removing any trace of themselves.
